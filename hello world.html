David A. Sinclair begins his presentation with the statement that we all have only one life that’s worth prolonging in good health.<br><br>
Our craving to become immortal commenced from ancient times.<br><br>
We made the afterlife, incarnations, and religions that defined the value of death because we feared death.<br><br>
WHO’s 32-page report explains that aging is one of the biggest problems of our generations.<br><br>
The present medicine used succeeded in preventing premature death.<br><br>
By medical developments, our average lifetime doubled.<br><br>
Medicine saved the elderly from death.
But it failed to reverse aging, and the weak, nonproductive, and often suffering elderly were left.<br><br>
Unless we do something to keep the elderly healthy, the cost will crush national infrastructures, and our lives will fall.<br><br>
Sinclair states that 99% of the reports related to aging attempt to slow down diseases individually.<br><br>
But these diseases make only a small fraction of us suffer.<br><br>
But aging affects all of us.<br><br>
According to the graph, which Sinclair showed us, the medicine we use commonly isn’t making us healthier.<br><br>
Although the technology to fix us grows, the percentage of our life living healthy is decreasing.<br><br>
The medicine we take at the hospital deals with diseases, the consequences of aging.<br><br>
But when we finally figure out how to cure a disease, mutations happen and change its gene again, and we need to start it over again.<br><br>
Take an example of COVID-19, a threatening virus which we found out cures.<br><br>
As soon as we created AstraZeneca and Moderna, mutations happened to COVID-19 and made a new variant.<br><br>
The existing vaccines don’t work at them.<br><br>
Consequently, we are switching diseases out.<br><br>
David thought this wasn’t the best way to approach.<br><br>
Sinclair began to determine how yeast cells grow old, and he found out that as they grow old, their genes start to switch on.<br><br>
The genes that needed to be off were on.<br><br>
When this theory formed, Sinclair realized that there is a chance for us to win against aging.<br><br>
We thought that irreversible mutations caused aging.<br><br>
However, Sinclair discovered that aging was an epigenetic change, which was reversible.<br><br>
Sinclair found out genes that slow this process called SIR2 (stands for Silent Information Regulator 2.).<br><br>
Seven of them are called sirtuins.<br><br>
Whenever we skip a meal or exercise, we stimulate these genes.<br><br>
But these methods weren’t enough to reverse aging.<br><br>
Sinclair researched a better way to provoke these sirtuins and help them work faster.<br><br>
What he found was resveratrol in red wine.<br><br>
Resveratrol slows down many symptoms of aging.<br><br>
It could help reduce the pressure (which increases as we get old) exerted on artery walls when the heartbeats.<br><br>
If this pressure is high, it could be a risk factor for serious heart diseases.

But to reverse age, we need to eat 100 glasses a day.<br><br>
We had to discover another substance, which was more effective than resveratrol.<br><br>
Then, unfortunately, the largest pharmaceutical company released a report that resveratrol’s effect on sirtuins was wrong.<br><br>
Sinclair was depressed, but he didn’t give up his research.<br><br>
He proved that the company’s reports which opposed him were wrong.<br><br>
David found out one chemical 100 times more potent than resveratrol, and it looked safe to humans.<br><br>
Sinclair hopes that we could postpone the effects of aging only by a pill until our 90s.<br><br>
